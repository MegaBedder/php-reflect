PHP_Reflect is a PHP Library that adds the ability to reverse-engineer 
classes, interfaces, functions, constants, namespaces and more.


*Why PHP_Reflect is different to standard PHP5 Reflection API ?*

With _PHP5 Reflection API_ the code to analyze needs to be loaded and interpreted 
by the php interpreter, and in certain cases, this triggers fatal errors. 

With _PHP_Reflect_ you don't have to trust in source code, because it will be parsed
with tokenizer extension. 

=== Features

* ability to reverse-engineer classes
* ability to reverse-engineer traits
* ability to reverse-engineer interfaces
* ability to reverse-engineer functions
* ability to reverse-engineer constants

* ability to extend the parsing level: connect user callbacks to handle more tokens
