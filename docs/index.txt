== Introduction

PHP_Reflect adds the ability to reverse-engineer classes, interfaces, functions, 
constants, namespaces and more. 


*Why PHP_Reflect is different to standard PHP5 Reflection API ?*

With _PHP5 Reflection API_ the code to analyze needs to be loaded and interpreted 
by the php interpreter, and in certain cases, this triggers fatal errors. 

With _PHP_Reflect_ you don't have to trust in source code, because it will be parsed
with tokenizer extension.
