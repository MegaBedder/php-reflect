Additions and changes:
- none

CAUTION: this version is the last to support PHP 5.2. Next API 2.0 will drop this support

Bug fixes:
- avoid wrong namespace detection if source code used a class property named namespace: $this->namespace
(Thanks to Remi Collet to notice me a strong behavior in class report)
